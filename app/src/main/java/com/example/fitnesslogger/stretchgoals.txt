create ability too add exercise - shows a dropdown menu of avaiable groups to add to, asks to write name which is require, then an image which is optional
if no image is chosen then defualt to an add button sign

use database paging for large sets

create csv i/o to import/export data

if a day is multiple muscle groups, blend the colors because currently it will just choose the first thing

have a lot of logic that assumes the user did more than 1 set. will need to find work arounds to these or different solutions

add the ability to favorite exerises so they show up first
