delete the unneeded repos in calendarViewModel


change liveData to Flow

move to a proper MVVM architecture where fragments are strictly ui related and I handle everything
else in the viewModel


for removing:  when removing all exerciseSet Sets, It should remove the corresponding exercise entity
if when remove on exerciseSet when exerciseSet set = 1, call delete on the corresponding exerciseID
